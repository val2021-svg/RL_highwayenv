# RL_highwayenv

This project explores the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied to various simulated driving environments, focusing on the Highway-env collection. Our main goal is to understand how RL algorithms perform in different simulated driving scenarios and contribute to the development of autonomous vehicle technologies.

## Project Overview

We implement and test RL algorithms across three selected driving scenarios to examine their performance under various conditions. The insights gained aim to advance the technologies behind autonomous vehicles and identify the best strategies for employing RL in real-world driving applications.


## Environments Described

1. **Highway**: Simulates a complex highway driving scenario with multiple lanes and dynamic vehicle behavior.
2. **Continuous Actions**: A variant of the highway environment that supports continuous action spaces.
3. **Stable Baselines**: Utilizes Stable Baselines library to implement more complex RL strategies in an environment configured for high-density traffic scenarios.
